## GitHub Websites

Hosting a website on GitHub is free with a GitHub account. With a GitHub account, you get one site and organization, and unlimited project sites.

### Create GitHub Account

To create an account, go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/){target=_blank}, click **Sign up**, then follow the prompts to create an account.

### Create Public Repository

To create a website on GitHub, you need a public repository. While other people can see your public repository, they cannot make changes to your repository if they are not a contributor that you have allowed. Other users can fork your repository, but they are just making a copy of your repository and editing their copy, not your original.

### Test GitHub Website

Include steps on creating a simple index file to test accessing the GitHub website.
