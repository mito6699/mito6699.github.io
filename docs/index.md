This site uses GitHub for version control and Material for MKDocs for the documentation website. For full documentation visit [GitHub](https://github.com/){target=_blank} and [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){target=_blank}.

## GitHub

GitHub provides version control and is a platform for collaborating with others on projects. GitHub provides this service at no cost, making it a great place for open-source projects.

This site is hosted directly from a GitHub repository, making it an ideal way to share examples for technical writing and content management.

## Material for MKDocs

Material for MKDocs is a framework on top of MKDocs that adds functionality for documentation websites.

Material for MKDocs is an open-source project that also includes a paid insiders program for early-access to new features.

This site uses the open-source project, not the insiders project.
